                <p>
                Here at Touchdown Aviation, we are your one stop shop for all your aviation requirements, including ground subjects. We understand that each student's needs are unique, so we offer you the flexibility of choosing the subjects you want to do. You can pick and choose subjects, or do them all.
                </p>
                <p>
                We offer the following ground subjects:
                <ul>
                <li>
                Navigation
                </li>

                <p>
                Our courses are 12-14 weeks long. We align our courses with the DGCA exams so that you can take the exam just after the end of the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are committed to assist you in your studies. Our system of weekly tests and feedback lets you (and us) know what your strengths and weaknesses are.
